    "They suggest `Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree graph kernel` and the `Graph Kernels` python package. \n",
    "\n",
    "They use python's `scikit-learn` to compare several different methods and found that **Random Forest** worked the best among the 8 sample datasets. I think it could be a good choice for us, but this model also took the longest amount of time to train. This could be an important consideration for us depending on how we decide to train (Get a cluster?).\n",
